## Introduction

Dl cup is a website for a University football tournament that includes table standings, match results and statistics. It's one of a series of projects I made for football tournaments while in University, which include motion graphics with css([walk up video](https://github.com/BarokDG/Walk-Up) and [schedule graphics](https://barokdg.github.io/schedule-graphics)), an admin dashboard for dl cup, and a web app similar to dl cup for a different tournament([source](https://github.com/barokdg/gc-cup)).

## Folder structure

On the top level, there are four folders - "client", "dlcup-admin", "screenshots", and "server".

### Client

This is where all the frontend code is. I've setup netlify to update on new commits to this folder. The main folder structure is from the create-react-app template so it's very basic. I plan to migrate to typescript very soon.

### Dlcup-Admin

This is a separate MERN stack admin app. The league was discontinued before I could finish this app but I've implemented some of the features. Inside this folder there are two subfolders called "admin" and "server". The "admin" folder holds the frontend code while the "server" folder holds the backend.

### Screenshots

This folder contains the images that are at the bottom of this readme file.

### Server

This is where the back end application that serves data to the client is located. It's built with express.js and mongodb.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) version 14+
- [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com)

## Installation

Navigate to the client folder, open the terminal, and run

```bash
npm install
```

AFter everything is installed, run

```bash
npm run start
```

:arrow_right: Repeat the same process inside the server folder, to launch the api

:arrow_right: Same process for launching the admin app too!
