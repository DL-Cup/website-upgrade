## Introduction
Dl cup is a website for a University football tournament that includes table standings, match results and statistics. It's one of a series of projects I made for football tournaments while in University, which include motion graphics with css([walk up video](https://github.com/BarokDG/Walk-Up) and [schedule graphics](https://barokdg.github.io/schedule-graphics)), an admin dashboard for dl cup, and a web app similar to dl cup for a different tournament.([source](https://github.com/barokdg/gc-cup)). 

## Folder structure
On the top level, there are three folders - "client", "screenshots", and "server". 

### Client
This is where all the frontend code is. I've setup netlify to update on new commits to this folder. The main folder structure is from the create-react-app template so it's very basic. I plan to migrate to typescript very soon. I also plan on making the website responsive for desktop. When I first built it, I was very busy with school and couldn't come up with a design I was happy with. I will try to get back to that task ASAP.

### Screenshots
This folder contains the images that are at the bottom of this readme file.

### Server
This is where the back end application that serves data to the client is located. It's built with express.js and mongodb.

## Prerequisites
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) version 14+
- [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com)

## Installation
Navigate to the client folder, open the terminal, and run
```bash
npm install
```

AFter everything is installed, run
```bash
npm run start
```

:arrow_right: Repeat the same process inside the server folder, to launch the api
